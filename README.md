# ALiVE + CAF | Uprising

Uprising is a multiplayer mission built for ARMA 3 using the [CBA](http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=18767),
[ALiVE](http://alivemod.com/), and [CAF Aggressors](http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?172069-Arma3-AGGRESSORS)
mods. It was built in parallel with writing a [detailed tutorial](https://medium.com/the-creation-of-alive-uprising/)
on working with ALiVE for other aspiring mission makers.

## Mission Overview
Several months ago, an extremely well-equipped militia invaded the Mediterranean island of Stratis. Woefully
unprepared for any military action, the island was minimally protected. The militia quickly overran all military
installations and entrenched themselves; they have held a tight grip on the resources and the entire population of
Stratis since.

In the weeks since the assault, a small but well-trained group of resistance fighters have been working to oust the
invaders â€” organizing a militia of their own, recruiting the Stratis population to their cause, and sabotaging the
militia at every opportunity.

As tensions on the nearby island of Altis have escalated in recent months, NATO military forces have also taken a
strategic interest in the tiny island of Stratis; should a large-scale war break out on Altis, Stratis would quickly
become a crucial strategic location to hold. NATO has dispatched a small contingent of troops to assist in restoring
stability to Stratis.
